# interviewing_refactoring_node
ApplicationReview contains some less than ideal code. Given that we do not want to change its output or usage, refactor the class using tools or strategies of your choosing.

Make edits in `packages/refactor/src/application.review.ts` and test against desired output via `npm test`

Install dependencies with `npm install`
